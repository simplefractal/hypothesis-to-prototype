11. [15] Q & A


## Ideation Process
1. How do you come up with an idea?
2. How do you go past the idea stage?
3. How are things different now compared to a decado ago and why?


## Hypotheses
1. What is a hypothesis?
2. How do you distinguish a good hypothesis from a bad one?
3. Exercise: Formulate your project hypothesis
4. Critique each other's hypotheses and see if you can improve them
5. How do we accept/reject a hypothesis?


## Data Collection
1. Why is it important to determine what data to collect?
2. What are some general metrics we could collect to accept/reject a hypothesis?
3. What are the ideal characteristics of the data we collect?
4. What is A/B testing and how does it work?
5. Exercises: What metric(s) would you measure for testing the success of the following hypotheses?
    a. Voice control for sports stats will increase engagement on our sports websites by at least 20%
    b. New pricing model for all-inclusive access will increase cross-platform engagement
    c. Sports betting feature will increase revenue from sports channels by at least 10%
    d. Crowdsourced voting for trending content will increase user engagement
    e. Gamification of our content channels will increase user engagement
    f. Promotional text messages will increase user acquisition for our other channels by 10% or more


### Combined Template
1. Formula: [Feature] will result in [outcome], as indicated by [measured metric]
2. Exercise: Revise your project hypothesis to adhere to this format.


## Prototype
1. What does the ideal experiment look like?
2. What is the concept of a test group vs. control group?
3. How do you handle multiple experiments running?
4. Exercise: Determine the following for each hypothesis below:
    - Test group UX
    - Control group UX
    - How to split test and control groups
    - How to track the below metrics:
        1. Making it harder to close out signup modal will increase user acquisition, as indicated by daily signups increasing 10%.
        2. Moderating comments on articles will increase user engagement
        3. Promotional text messages will increase user acquisition for our other channels by 10% or more


## Decisions
1. At the end of hypothesis-driven development, how do you make a business decision?
2. Who is the decision-maker?
3. How do you convince the decision-maker?
4. What forms could the decision take?
5. How do you measure the results of a decision?


## Summary
1. In the modern world we should take advantage of the ability to be scientific and efficient in testing out our business hypotheses.
2. It's important to formulate a good hypothesis along with the metrics to measure and required [sample size](https://www.optimizely.com/sample-size-calculator/) for significance.
3. We can leverage modern technologies and tools to construct an experiment quickly and cheaply compared to the past.
4. It's important to recognize the limitations of the experiment to make a trustworthy, yet compelling pitch to resourceholders and decision-makers.
5. It's ok if the hypothesis is rejected - the important thing is that it was a worthwhile shot and extracted key learnings from it.
